Thanks for purchasing Weapon Bobbing Script Pack V2!

To use Weapon Bobbing Script Pack V2, please read documentation included.

This package doesn't include any player controller features, it only gives you the how weapon object moves.

There are 4 bobbing scripts and each of them requires some settings, so please read the documentation.

If you want to quick demo test with playable controller, I'd recommend you to use Unity's Standard Asset, there is a prefab called FPSController.

Note that recently Unity doesn't allow to include Standard Asset on publish package so that's why there's no controller in this package.

You can see the tutorial video to how to setup with Unity's Standard FPSController Asset.

There is a script called DemoBobController which controls running animation as well, was made for gives you a quick idea to how to make running animation with this package.

Note that DemoBobController was built for only works with Unity's Standard FPSController, not others.

If you have any question, don't hesitate to ask to me: rico345100@gmail.com
